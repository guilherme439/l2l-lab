## General

- Keep the README.md and the documentation inside docs/ updated as things change in the code.
- Make sure you have the venv activated, before running anything.


## Imports

- Avoid conditional imports.


## Typing

- Use modern type-hint syntax everywhere: builtin generics (`list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, `tuple[int, ...]`) over `typing.List` / `typing.Dict`, `Optional[X]` for nullable types (not `X | None`), and annotate return types on every function — including `-> None` for procedures.


## Code layout

- _private functions/methods should always come after public ones.


## Comments & docstrings

- Do not erase comments, unless they dont make sence anymore.
- Write docstrings for modules, public classes, and non-trivial algorithms only — skip them for self-evident code. Docstrings describe the function's contract; they should not narrate the current implementation, nor reference specific call sites that might move.
- Do not put conversation-specific comments in the code.


## Output

- Use `logging.getLogger("alphazoo")` for output, not `print`.
